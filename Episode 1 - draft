[WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE]

[CHAPTER 1]
THE SKY BECAME HIDDEN IN THE DARK BY THE SHADOWS OF GIGANTIC TOWERS.
DEMOLISHED BUILDINGS SCATTERED THE EARTH, AND THE SOUNDS OF SCREAMING AND MOANING COULD BE HEARD.

AND THEN,THERE WAS SILENCE.

OOD WILL EXI

“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE. P-PLEASE, EVACUATE… EVACUATE…!”

“THE FREE SERVICE OF THE 8612TH PLANETARY SYSTEM HAS COME TO AN END.”
Crackle crackle
“THE MAIN SCENARIO WILL BEGIN NOW”

TWO SMALL HORNS.

A DOWNY CREATURE WEARING A STRAW GARMENT WAS FLOATING MIDAIR.

IT WAS TOO PECULIAR TO BE CALLED A FAIRY, TOO MALICIOUS TO BE CALLED AN ANGEL, TOO INNOCENT LOOKING TO BE CALLED A DEVIL.

SO IT WAS…/
SO WE CALLED IT A DOKKAEBI.

“IT’S A DOKKAEBI!*”, SOMEONE EXCLAIMED AS THE CREATURE SPRUNG INTO VIEW.
*A DOKKAEBI IS A MYTHICAL CREATURE THAT IS SIMILAR TO A GOBLIN.

AT THAT MOMENT, FICTION AND REALITY OVERLAPPED.

“TESTING. TESTING. CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME?
GOSH THE LANGUAGE PATCH WAS MALFUNCTIONING FOR A BIT
CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME NOW?”

CHATTER, COMPLAINTS ABOUT TRAIN STOP, COMPENSATION ASKING…

“IT SURE IS NOISY HERE, ISN’T IT?
I…
…TOLD YOU…
TO BE QUIET!”
SPLATTER (EXPLOSE AN HEAD)

“WE ARE NOT FILMING A MOVIE.”
ONE MORE
“THIS ISN’T A DREAM…”
5 MORE
“...OR A NOVEL…
AND IT CERTAINLY ISN’T THE REALITY THAT YOU ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH1 DO YOU UNDERSTAND?”

“ALL OF YOU HAVE HAD QUITE A CUSHY LIFE UNTIL NOW HAVEN’T YOU?
YOU WERE ABLE TO BREATHE, EAT, EXCRETE, AND REPRODUCE WITHOUT PAYING THE COSTS! HA!
YOU’VE ALL BEEN ENJOYING PRIVILEGED LIVES!
BUT IT’S ALL OVER NOW.
NOTHING IS FREE IN LIFE, ISN’T THAT RIGHT?”

…

“HA… THERE IS NO TIME FOR CHITCHAT. YOUR DEBT IS PILING UP AS WE SPEAK.
I WON’T BOTHER EXPLAINING IT TO YOU, IT WILL BE FASTER FOR YOU TO TRY AND EARN THE MONEY YOURSELVES.”
