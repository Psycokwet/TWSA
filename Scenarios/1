discovery of dokkaebi and paywall
panic
people get killed as an example 
national emergency declared
national tv broadcast thinking there is terrorists attacks 
"There have been reports of unidentified terrorists attacks, in seoul as well as many others areas of the country 
the country will combat these attacks using all means necessary ..."
speech made by prime minister which is unusual (should have been president)
comments and rumours under video says president have been already compromised by terrorists
3 bangs, prime minister is killed live, then a dokkaebi appears on the screen 
and image and sound crackle, unstable 
"I ALREADY TOLD YOU, THIS IS NOT JUST SOME JOKE LIKE TERRORISM"
dokkaebi's face is deformed and scarier than ever
